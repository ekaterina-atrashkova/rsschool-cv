      <p>
        I have more than three years of experience in tourist and sales sector
        where I’ve been working as a public relations and sales executive
        specialist. The last year I came across testing and quality assurance in
        tech, I was so excited, so I started to study it by myself. For me
        testing is a creative activity, every day I can face various kinds of
        tasks, find interesting solutions for them and communicate with people.
        After the courses of Software Testing, I realized for myself that this
        is the area where I would like to develop and there are lots of
        opportunities for me there.
