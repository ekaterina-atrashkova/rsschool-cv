I have more than three years of experience in tourist and sales sector where I’ve been working as a public relations and sales executive specialist. The last year I came across testing and quality assurance in tech, I was so excited, so I started to study it by myself. For me testing is a creative activity, every day I can face various kinds of tasks, find interesting solutions for them and communicate with people.
After the courses of Software Testing, I realized for myself that this is the area where I would like to develop and there are lots of opportunities for me there.
